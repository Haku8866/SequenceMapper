# SequenceMapper

This is a tool which can be used to assist someone playing the board game "Sequence".

# Features

The number of one-eyed and two-eyed jacks remaining will be shown at the side of the screen.
The chance of picking up one of these will be shown as well.

Additionally, when there are a number of counters in a row ready to make a sequence a line will be drawn through them.
The more counters there are, the bolder the line will be. The squares on the board will also be highlighted to show how probable it is to attain its corresponding card.
This allows the player to easily see where they can make sequences and play better.

# Usage

Left click a square to place a counter. This will place the card in the discard pile.

Left click a counter to use a one-eyed jack on your turn and remove a counter.

Right click a counter to use a two-eyed jack on your turn and place a counter.

If a counter is placed on a red square (meaning all the cards are used) then a two-eyed jack will automatically be used.
